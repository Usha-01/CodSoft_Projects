                    Hello, I am Usha Kalathinathan. I am currently pursuing my degree in Information Technology at Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology. My passion for developing web pages and applications led me to choose this field of study. I find immense joy in creating user-friendly and efficient solutions that can make a difference in people's lives.
                    
                    In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a variety of hobbies that keep me engaged and inspired. I love reading books and novels, which not only provide a great escape into different worlds but also enrich my knowledge and perspective. Playing badminton is another activity I thoroughly enjoy; it helps me stay active and sharp both physically and mentally.
                    
                    I am also an avid learner, constantly seeking to acquire new skills and knowledge. 
                   <p>

                <h3>Online voting and polling</h3>
                <img src="C:\Users\ushak\Pictures\ovps.jpg" alt="Project 1">
                <p>I have developed a webpage for "Online Voting and Polling" specifically designed for college-level elections at Sri Krishna College of Engineering and Technology. This platform allows students to cast their votes for candidates running for the position of college president.

                    The election process is inclusive, enabling students from all departments to participate and vote. Each department nominates a candidate to stand for president, and students have the flexibility to vote for candidates from their own department as well as candidates from other departments. This ensures a fair and comprehensive election process that engages the entire college community.
                    
                    The online voting system is designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient, making it easier for students to exercise their voting rights and contribute to the democratic process within the college. By implementing this online platform, we aim to streamline the election process, increase participation, and ensure that the voices of all students are heard.
                    
                    Overall, this project not only enhances the election experience for students but also demonstrates the practical application of web development skills in creating solutions that benefit the community. </p>

                <h3>Boat house booking System</h3>
                <img src="C:\Users\ushak\Pictures\boat-01.jpg" alt="Project 2">
                <p>I have developed a web application for booking boat houses for vacation purposes. This Online Boat House Booking Platform serves as a digital gateway for users seeking unique and immersive accommodations on the water. The platform provides a user-friendly environment for discovering, selecting, and reserving boat houses tailored to individual preferences. The booking system is designed with straightforward steps, allowing customers to quickly search for available boat houses and make reservations with ease.
                     This streamlined approach ensures an efficient and enjoyable booking experience for all users.

                <h3>Motor management System</h3>
                <img src="C:\Users\ushak\Pictures\Motor-management.jpg" alt="Project 3">
                <p>I have developed this project as a team.Our project revolves around the development of an intelligent motor
                    management system for electric vehicles, employing machine learning
                    techniques, specifically K-means clustering and the Random Forest algorithm.
                    The initiative begins with the comprehensive collection of data about electric
                    vehicle motor parameters, including temperature, voltage, current, and speed.
                    Following meticulous data preprocessing to address missing values and outliers,
                    the focus shifts to feature selection, identifying pivotal variables for predictive
                    modeling.
